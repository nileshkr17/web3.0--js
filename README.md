🔗 Learn Blockchain Programming with JavaScript

## Description

🚀 This course project, guided by Mohammad Azam, provides a comprehensive introduction to blockchain technology and its effective implementation using JavaScript. You will gain hands-on experience in programming your own blockchain, understanding its core concepts, deploying it to the cloud, and achieving decentralization. Mohammad starts by covering topics such as cryptocurrencies, centralized and distributed ledgers, public and private keys, and mining. Then, you will dive into implementing the blockchain core engine and web API, followed by the steps required to decentralize your blockchain.

## Features

✅ Create and host a blockchain using Node.js and Express.js.
🔒 Secure data integrity using sha-256 hashing.
🔄 Conflict resolution through the longest node selection method.
📡 API endpoints:
  - `/resolve`: Resolve conflicts between nodes.
  - `/nodes/register`: Register new nodes in the network.
  - `/transaction`: Add new transactions to the blockchain.
  - `/blockchain`: Get the current state of the blockchain.
  - `/mine`: Mine new blocks and add them to the blockchain.
